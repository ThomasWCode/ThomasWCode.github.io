        <h2>About Me - An Overview</h2>
        <p>I'm 15 years old, growing up in the center of London. My main interests are programming (and other techy stuff), astrophysics, particle physics and hiking.</p>
        <p>At school, my favourite subjects are Physics, DT and German.</p>

        <h2>About Me - Programming</h2>
        <p>I started coding when I was 7. My first language was Lua, and I quicking moved on to Python. Which is still my favourite language.</p>
        <p>My strongest language is Python, then JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS. I have worked briefly with C++.</p>
        <p>In python, I have made many projects, ranging from physics simulations to simple Chrome Dino games, and a few 3D games (like a simple version of Minecraft).</p>
        <p>In HTML, CSS and JS, I have made a few websites. This includes the one you are currently reading as well as others that advise my present such as for programming tutoring.</p>
        <p>I made a website using Squarespace for the Friend Group of an Islington Council park - drag and drop features including some embedded code. You can <a href="https://stjohnsgardenEC1.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access the website here</a> and find my name in the footer.</p>
