        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p class="h3-text">I started coding when I was 7. My first language was Lua. I quickly moved onto Python. Which is still my favourite language.</p>
        <p class="h3-text">My strongest language is Python, then JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS. I have worked briefly with C++.</p>
        <p class="h3-text">In python, I have made many projects, ranging from physics simulations to 2D games like Chrome Dino, chess and minesweeper, and a few 3D games (like a simple version of Minecraft).</p>
        <p class="h3-text">In HTML, CSS and JS, I have made a few websites. This includes the one you are currently reading as well as others that advertise my presence such as for programming tutoring.</p>
        <p class="h3-text">I made a website using Squarespace for the Friend Group of St John's Garden (an Islington Council park) - drag and drop features including some embedded code. You can <a href="https://stjohnsgardenEC1.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out the website here</a>.</p>
