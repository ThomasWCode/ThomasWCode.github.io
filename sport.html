                <h2>Running</h2>
                <p class="h3-text">I enjoy running and go to my local 5k Parkrun every saturday with friends. My current 5k PB is 21:59.</p>
                <p class="h3-text">I have been participating in a <a href="https://www.spartan.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spartan Race</a> each year for 3 years with my dad and friends, which I really love. So far, I have done a Kids 2.5k, a 5k, and a 10k.</p>
                <p class="h3-text">The races involve running a distance while beat 25 to 50 obstacles like walls, barbed wire, carrying sandbags and more. Highly recommended.</p>
                <p class="h3-text">With the same friends, I do the Brighton triathlon each year. I find it really fun although the swim can be just a tiny bit cold :)</p>

                <h2>My Other Sports</h2>
                <p class="h3-text">I played squash between the ages of 8 to 13. Although I was coached for a few months, I mainly just played for fun. I took park in a few tournaments, ranking between 3rd and 6th.</p>
                <p class="h3-text">Along with squash, I really enjoy tennis. I play at school during the summer term and play with friends at summer camps and sometimes on weekends.</p>
                <p class="h3-text">Football has never been my best sport. I have only ever played it at school, finding myself in the E team (A then B then C, D, E, F, G).</p>
